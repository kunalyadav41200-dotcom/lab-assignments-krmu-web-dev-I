Page Setup

I started with <!DOCTYPE html> to show it’s HTML5.

<html lang="en"> means the page is in English.

In the head part, I added the title and basic setup like charset and viewport.

Header and Menu

At the top, I put my name inside <header>.

Then I made a small navigation menu using <nav> and <ul> with links to About, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections.

Hero Section

This is like the welcome part of the page.

It has a heading “Welcome to My Portfolio” and a small intro about me being a student.

About Section

Here I added my photo with <img> and wrote a short paragraph about myself.

Basically, it says I’m a computer science student who likes making websites and solving problems.

Projects Section

I listed 3 projects inside <ul>.

Each project has its own <article> with a title and description.

Projects are like my portfolio examples.

Skills Section

I made a table with two columns: one for the skill and one for my level (like Completed, Learning, Pending).

It shows where I stand in HTML, CSS, and Java.

Contact Section

At the end, I made a contact form with fields for name, email, and message.

I used placeholder and required so it’s easier to fill in.

There’s also a “Send” button.

Overall

This website is only in HTML, no CSS yet.
It looks simple, but it has all the main sections: About, Projects, Skills, and Contact.
The code is neat and easy to style later.
Honestly, it looks like a college student’s first portfolio — basic but complete
